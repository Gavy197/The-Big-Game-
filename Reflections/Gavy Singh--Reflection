My primary responsibilities in this project included designing and implementing the inventory system and health bar. One of the biggest challenges I had during this project was figuring out how to properly remove items from the inventory when they were consumed, especially when it came to subtracting one item/resource and not the whole slot. I now understand signals, @onready, and @exports better. This project massively improve my comfort using GitHub. I became more confident with branching, resolving merge conflicts, and repos. I learned how to troubleshoot better using line breaks as well. I think my next project is going to be a lot better with all this knowledge I now have from this RPG game project.
